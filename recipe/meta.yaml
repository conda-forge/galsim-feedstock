  summary: The modular galaxy image simulation toolkit
  description: |
    GalSim is open-source software for simulating images of astronomical objects
    (stars, galaxies) in a variety of ways. The bulk of the calculations are
    carried out in C++, and the user interface is in python. In addition, the
    code can operate directly on "config" files, for those users who prefer not
    to work in python. (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26C....10..121R)
